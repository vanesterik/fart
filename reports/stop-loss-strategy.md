# Swing Low Stop-Loss Strategy

This strategy is based on the idea of setting the stop-loss at the most recent swing low. The strategy is simple and can be used on any time frame. The strategy is based on the idea that the most recent swing low is a good place to set the stop-loss because it is a level where the market has shown support in the past.

Apply the following rules to the strategy:

- Set the stop-loss at the most recent swing low
- Make at least 1.5 times the stop-loss amount on every trade (risk-reward ratio of 1.5:1)
