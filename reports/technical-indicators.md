# Technical Indicators

Technical indicators are used to analyze the price movements of a stock. They are used to predict future price movements based on historical data. The following are some of the most commonly used technical indicators:

## RSI - Overbought vs Oversold

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. The RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally the RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30.

- Set the RSI period to 4
- Buy signal is generated when RSI crosses above 30
- Sell signal is generated when RSI crosses below 70

## Moving Average - Trending vs Ranging

The moving average is a widely used indicator in technical analysis that helps smooth out price action by filtering out the “noise” from random price fluctuations. It is a trend-following, or lagging, indicator because it is based on past prices.

- Three different moving averages: 20, 50, 100
- All three moving averages should go in the same direction to confirm the trend

## Bolleger Bands - Volatility

Bollinger Bands are a type of statistical chart characterizing the prices and volatility over time of a financial instrument or commodity. The bands are plotted two standard deviations above and below a simple moving average.

- Buy signal is generated when the price touches or moves below the lower band
- Sell signal is generated when the price touches or moves above the upper band
